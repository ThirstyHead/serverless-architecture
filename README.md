# PRESENTATION: Practical Examples of Serverless Architecture

When John Gage, Chief Scientist at Sun Microsystems, said, "The network is the computer", Sun was in the business of selling expensive, premium network servers. It's hard to talk about "networks" without immediately mentioning "servers" in the same breath -- web servers, email servers,  database servers, and the list goes on from there.

But what does a networked app look like without the server? In this talk, Scott Davis (Principal Engineer with ThoughtWorks) quickly walks through a spectrum of cloud-networked environments, from Platform as a Service (PaaS) to Container Hosting (Docker, et al). After that, we walk down the evolutionary trail from Microservices and Backend as a Service (BaaS) to examples of canonical, truly serverless solutions like Webhooks and AWS Lambda -- what some folks are calling Functions as a Service, or FaaS.

Along the way, we'll look at real-life case studies and use cases for Serverless solutions, like GitHub, Stripe, and building Conversational UIs with Amazon Alexa. The server isn't dead (yet), but web frameworks like https://serverless.com sure make an intriguing argument.
